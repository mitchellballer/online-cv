    Due to Georgia Tech's academic integrity policy I'm unable to make my code publicly available. So I've sumarized major projects below.
    If you would like to see code snippets or hear more, just drop me an email and I'd love to talk!
  assignments:
    - title: Operating Systems, multithreaded getfile server
      link:
      tagline: "Implemented multithreaded Getfile client library and multithreaded Getfile server library in C."
      details: |
        - Client side interface influenced by Libcurl 'easy' interface.
        - Server side interface influenced by python's built in httpserver.
